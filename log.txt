Project Updates

1. Project Basics
Framework to be used : AngularJS for front end client
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

1.1 Brief Technical Description of the project
It will be a SPA (Single Page Application) web app developed using the AngularJS framework. 

2. Things to be done 

2.1 Basic UI Design 0%
The basic UI sketch has to be done ASAP. 

2.2 Login function 0%
Each user has to be able to log in to their own accounts. (For a start we don't have to link to their NUS accounts yet. Probably have a sign up page for them to create their own account.) 
- Possibly use a hash table to save their log in details.
- Possibly make use of cookies to cache their log in.

2.3 Food Orders  0%
Selection of food orders and special requests. (Can possibly put in some pictures and clickables instead of text boxes for the people to fill in). 

2.4 Food Ready Alert  0%
I don't think it is possible to create notifications on a webapp. (Alert 1.) Probably not a local phone notification but a browser server side notification. May not be a very good implementation.

2.5 Counter for amount of orders  0%
This may be quite easy to implement. Leave it for another day to discuss about it.

2.6 Secured payment for food  0%
Big challenge. May not be possible over the course of orbital.
